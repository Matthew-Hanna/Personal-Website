        <div class="biotext">
          During my first term at the University of Waterloo, I led a team of 4 to simplify the process of learning to ride a bicycle. Initally, we developed our first report which explained why this issue was viable, and generated proof of concept models. For our second report and presentation, we developed a primary functional model and evaluated it with tests. Finally, we took our incites and published a final report, developed a functional prototype, and conducted tests to verify that it achieved our goal.

        <div class="biotext">
          With a team of 4, I developed various recommendations to improve the infusion pump from a Human Factors perspective, and developed various prototypes that responded to the concerns posed primarily by the FDA. I believe the most fruitful of our prototypes was the concept of an application. The concept of the application is to alert nurses via their cellphone to ensure the patient has a quieter environment, and provide the nurse with useful status updates presented by the infusion pump along with other devices to ensure that a nurse can quickly monitor the status of their patients.

        <div class="biotext">
          With the same group as I worked with for the biking project, we developed a cubic maze puzzle which was designed to captivate and entertain users of all ages. Initially, we prototyped our parts on a piece of paper and determined their dimensions. Afterwards, we assigned different parts to different teammates, but ultimately we had to coordinate it all together to ensure the pieces would fit together properly. Afterwards, we utilized Z-Suite to develop a 3-D print of our concept. Eventually, after trial and error we developed a product that seamlessly went together without glue, and that was as fun as we expected.
