      <div class="biotext">
            After completing my first year in Honours Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I have decided to embark on the path towards a specialization in Neuro-Engineering. With my experience in this program so far, I have obtained strong mathematical knowledge from calculus and linear algebra, worthwhile programming skills in C++ and C#, design management skills, the ability to develop promising prototypes, human factors knowledge, and organic and inorganic chemistry to a certain degree.

            Through 14 years of experience I have learned to follow the Kyo Hoon Code of Honour. This includes the values of respect, modesty, integrity, courage, and indomitable spirit. Over the years I strived to obtain these traits and consequently, I acquired my 3rd degree black belt, 4 provincial sparring gold medals, and competed in 3 national competitions and won bronze at the US World Open. Simultaneously, I instructed to give back to the sport I am so passionate about.

      <div class="biotext">
            In my minimal amount of spare time, I often enjoy activities such as reading about theoretical physics, history, or anything interesting about technology or design that catches my eye. However, I also focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle through indulging in various activities such as hiking, skiing, running, climbing, and plenty more. Overall, I simply enjoy keeping myself busy, and I have decided to do so in the most productive way possible.
